# About me

My name is Kacper Dalach. I am a aspiring engineer, mainly focusing on firmware development. 
My Journey with silicon chips began with 8-bit atmega and attiny MCUs.
During my school years I have dipped my toes in many different areas of software development but always felt attraction to embedded systems.

I always loved the idea of open source projects. This blog is my way of contributing to the open source community. I want to share whatever knowledge I have that might help other fellow engineers.

Hope that you find something for yourself.
